# Convention refers to the Solidworks file 6BarGeoModel.sldprt. n0-n3 refer to the 4 nodes of the 2 non-overlapping and non-point-view parallel rods in the front view starting with the bottom left one and going CW, n4-n7 refer to the same in the right view, and n8-n11 refer to the same in the top view. Make sure to verify with App6Bar.cpp for scaling constants.

# This is the yaml configuration file for the 6 bar tensegrity for drop tests. The file imports the 6BarSphere.yaml as a substructure and then imposes translations and rotations for initial drop height and orientation

substructures:
  6BarSphere:
    path: ./6BarSphere.yaml
    translation: [0, 10, 0]
    rotation:
      axis: [1, 1, 0]
      angle: 50

Trying to make the goat walk using most of the muscles and hierarchical CPGs hasn't been working out yet, so this is a second go at making the goat walk. In this simulation, most of the cables in the goat will not be actuated. Instead, new muscles will be added that lead to significant motion of the legs and spine. This is instead of using all the original muscles that incrementally add to the movement of the goat (or something like that).
